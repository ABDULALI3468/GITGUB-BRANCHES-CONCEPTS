The pop() method removes the last element from an array:

fruits.toString();

fruits[0] = "Kiwi";

fruits.length

myGirls.concat(myBoys);

fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi");

fruits.splice(0, 1); [ SPLICE METHOD CAN ADD DELETE ITEMS AT ANY POSITION SPECIFEID THAT WHY
 			I DONT USE POP,PUSH ,SHIFT AND UNSHIFT METHODS ]

fruits.slice(1); [SLICE METHOD SLICE ITEMS FROM SPECIFED POSITION INTO A NEW ARRAY ]
		   IF ONLY ONE VALUE IS GIVEN IT WILL START COUNTING FROM 0 AND WHEN THAT 
		   VALUE IS MATCHED IT WILL SLICE FROM THAT VALUE TILL END .

		   AND IT FOR THE SECOND VALUE IT WILL GO ONE MINUS TILL THAT VALUE FROM 0

fruits.slice(1, 3);
